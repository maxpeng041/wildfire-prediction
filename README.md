# wildfire-prediction
Climate change urges us to take immediate action if we do not wish to see extreme consequences on human life. The goal of this project is to assist the management of wildfire with machine learning. The cause of fire is be predicted using algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and K-Nearest Neighbors. The features include fire year, fire size, discovery day of year, latitude, and longitude. Random Forest and Gradient Boosting are further fine tuned using Randomized Search and Grid Search and achieves 0.62 accuracy with 0.60 f1 score when predicting a total of 11 fire causes.
